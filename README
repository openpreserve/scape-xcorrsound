XCORRSOUND

The xcorrSound package contains several tools.
 - overlap-analysis is a tool to find the overlap between two audio files.
 - waveform-compare is a tool that splits two audio files into equal sized blocks and outputs the correlation for each block (a_i,b_i), if a and b was the input.
 - sound-match is a tool to find the location of a small wavefile inside a big wavefile

The tools all make use of cross correlation, which can be computed through the Fourier transform.

Note that all the tools will need write access to a file called <tool>.log where various information about a run will be stored.

INSTALL

    The tools depend on FFTW3 and Boost program options. These can be found as debian packages.
    And as rpm packages. See install_dependencies.sh

    Download the repository, change directory to the repository and run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

    You will now find all the tools in build/apps/

BUILD DEBIAN PACKAGE

    Inside the build directory run:

    cpack -G DEB

    Now the .deb package file is in the build directory.

USE

Example: overlap-analysis

Syntax:

overlap-analysis <file1.wav> <file2.wav> [v<log level>]

Output example:

The best match was below the threshold of 0.2
Best at sample number: 11520000
Best at second: 240
Value of match was: 0.132016

In the log various information relating to the wav files can be found,
such as samplerate, number of channels and so on.
